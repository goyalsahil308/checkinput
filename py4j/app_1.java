 You have  matrix m [1000][1000] = [ [num py array]  , [], [], [],
              [], [], [], [][],
               [], [], [], [],[]
               ...
               ...] 

               input matrix n[5][5] = [[], [], []
                                       [] , []
                                       ....]
          You should print time taken to find it and it should consider all conditions
